## Project Description

`auth-rust` is a Rust project that showcases how to perform HTTP requests with basic authentication using the Reqwest crate.

### Tech Stack Used

- [Rust ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/): The programming language.
- [Reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/): A Rust HTTP client library.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If not, you can install them from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codescalper/auth-rust.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd auth-rust
   ```

### Running the Project

You can run the project with the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program will perform an HTTP GET request to "[http://httpbin.org/get](http://httpbin.org/get)" with basic authentication using the provided user and password (or None) and display the response.

## Importance

This project is important as it demonstrates how to make HTTP requests with basic authentication in Rust. It's a fundamental building block for building secure and authenticated communication with external services.

## Where to Use

1.  **API Authentication**: This project can be used as a starting point for Rust applications that need to authenticate and interact with external APIs.
2.  **HTTP Testing**: It's useful for testing and debugging HTTP requests with authentication to various web services.
